# Simple-Linear-Regression
Want to start you career in machine Learning?
The simplest and the most essential algorithm is the simple linear regression.
It is used to predict the value of an interval data like salary, Temperature, speed, etc.

I have done linear regression in python using sklearn library to predict the temperature based on the number of chirps by Cricket per second.
